I successfully completed the project using React.js and various packages to build the UI. I utilized React components for reusability and props to pass data between components. I implemented the react-modal package to display popup messages, the react-type-animation package for animating text, and react-icons for easy access to icons. Additionally, I used the useState hook to manage and update the state effectively.
